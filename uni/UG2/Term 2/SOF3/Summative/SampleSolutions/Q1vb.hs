The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Location Identifier is a unique and all uppercase 3-letter code used in aviation to identify an airport, for example LHR, JFK and BHX. 

For the purposes of this question, IATA location identifier should consist of only consonants "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ". 

Write a function `countIATA` that counts the number of IATA location identifiers in a list of strings. 

Your solution should satisfy:
