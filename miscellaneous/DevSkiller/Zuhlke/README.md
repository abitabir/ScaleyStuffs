# Student Details Application

This task evaluates the candidate's skills in `Python 3`.

## Introduction

The idea of this project is to work out electricity usage and charging for a street of houses

## Problem Statement

- Do *NOT* modify the test module. The code is designed so that you don't have to.
- Make tests pass by implementing missing features in the production code. 
- The only dependency is `pytest`. `pip3` should be part of your python3 installation.
- You'll see that there are types and functions declared in `app/electricitypricing.py`. These provide
  the starting point for your implementation. We've also added some type hints for the functions.
- Read the comments in the test and app modules. 

We suggest you make the tests pass one at a time, from the top of the test module downwards. That way you'll
have something working if you don't complete them all. 

You might not be able to make everything pass. This is OK and not necessarily a disqualifier 
as the exercise has to cover a wide range of skills.   

#### Get started by reading the comments in `electricity_pricing_tests.py`   

## Environment setup
#### We recommend approaching this exercise with an IDE such as PyCharm.
If you do choose to attempt this problem using the online IDE be aware that the tests are reordered by the platform,
please check the order in `electricity_pricing_tests.py`.
  
To execute the unit tests, use:

```
pip3 install -q -e . && python3 setup.py pytest
```
