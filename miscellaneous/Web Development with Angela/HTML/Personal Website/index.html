            The small task of pronouncing it how I'd like it <strong>A-bee-r</strong>, seems to be difficult for many. For the record, alternative pronunciations vary from: <br> <i>A-beer</i> 🍺 {I don't drink, mate}, <em>A-bae-r</em> 😍 {why, I'll take the compliment}, <em>A-bear</em> 🐻 {okay, I shall attempt to consider this optimistically - bears are beautiful creatures of God}, and - <em>ahem</em> I'll not bore you any further phonetics that I have tearfully been subjected to - the list could go on...
            <br>
            My point is, monolingual people are slightly quite very incapable of pronouncing foreign names. Not as a snide, just an observation after hapless awkwardnesses in tryings and failings XOSP. One should know when to give up, yup. The ones who try are indeed kind and respectful enough humans to seem like they care X')
            <br>
            As of such, I have developed a great hesitation whene'r social interactions occur in which new humans inquire of name as per conventions, which perturbs some {insert: how come this person doesn't know their own name}.
