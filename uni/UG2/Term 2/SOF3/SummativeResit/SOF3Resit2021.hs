You may use any values defined in the standard `Prelude`, but you may
not import any other module.  You may use Neil Mitchell's
[HoogÎ»e](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) to discover useful functions in
the `Prelude`.

Where tests accompany the English description of the problem, it is
not necessarily enough for your implementation to pass the tests to be
correct.

## Question 1 [35 marks]

## Question 2 [25 marks]

-}

{-
In this question you are asked to define types, as well as values.
Each type, *Name*, is given a default implementation as an alias for
the unit type: `type Name = ()`.  You may change the keyword `type` to
either `newtype` or `data` if appropriate, and you should replace the
unit type, `()`, by a suitable type expression.  You may derive any
type classes, such as `Show`, that will be useful.

Marks will be mostly given for how well the type protects the
programmer from mistakes, and also partly for the run-time efficiency
of the type.

Consider the game of
[*Mastermind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)),
where one player constructs a secret, known as a "code", and their
opponent has to guess the secret in a limited number of guesses.  Each
incorrect guess gives information to the guesser that they can use to
refine their guess.

A secret is represented as four distinct colours, in a particular
order, drawn from six possibilities:
-}
data Colour = Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Indigo
  deriving (Eq, Show, Read)
{-
A guess is also four distinct colours, in a particular order.

### Question 2(i) [4 marks]

guesses.  `Code` must be an instance of the `Eq` type class.

### Question 2(iii) [4 marks]

For each guess, the response is a pair of numbers:
1. The number of guess colours in the right position, and
2. The number of guess colours in the wrong position

Implement a type to represent responses to guesses.  `Response` must
be an instance of the `Eq` type class.
-}
type Response = (Int, Int) -- Replace with a suitable definition.

### Question 2(iv) [2 marks]

number of right colours in the wrong location.

Here `item` is an arbitrary type, whose values are identifiers of the
items stocked.  `StockF` maintains the database as a function that,
given an item identifier, returns the quantity in stock.  `StockL`
maintains the database as a list of pairs where the first element of
each pair is an item identifier, and the second is the quantity in
stock.

A small concrete example of item is `Item`, where

data Item = Loaf_White_Small | Loaf_Brown_Large | Single_Apple | Raisins_1kg
  deriving (Eq, Show)

but any type instantiating type class `Eq` can be used.

To help the software team decide between representations they have
commissioned you to produce pairs of functions for each task of
interest.  For each task below give **two** functions that solve the
problem, one function for each representation.

### Question 3(ii) [8 marks]

The supermarket can be restocked.  Implement the two operations that
produce the updated database.  Note that the incoming delivery of
stock can also be represented as a value of type `StockF` or `StockL`
as appropriate.  The first parameter to each function is the stock in
the shop, the second is the stock on the lorry bringing the new items.

### Question 3(iii) [8 marks]

The supermarket receives orders, which it fills as far as it can: for
example, if four apples are requested, but the supermarket only has
two, then only two will be removed from the stock.  Implement the two
operations that produce the updated database.

Note that the order can also be represented as a value of type
`StockF` or `StockL` as appropriate.  The first parameter to each
function is the stock in the shop, the second is the order.

This operation does **not** report the unfulfilled part of the order.

## Question 4 [10 marks]

Recall the definition of the `ProofLayout` type constructor:
-}
infixr 0 :=: -- the fixity and priority of the operator
data ProofLayout a = QED | a :=: ProofLayout a deriving Show
{-
Consider the following definitions from the standard prelude:
```haskell
(.) :: (a -> b) -> (c -> a) -> (c -> b)
(f . g) = f (g x)           -- (.).0

maybe :: a -> (b -> a) -> Maybe b -> a
maybe k f Nothing  = k      -- maybe.0
maybe k f (Just x) = f x    -- maybe.1
```

By exhibiting a suitable value of type `ProofLayout`, prove that
```haskell
â g :: a -> b, k :: a, f :: c -> a {g . maybe k f == maybe (g k) (g . f)}
```
Marks will be given for correct annotation, as well as correct proof steps.

#### Hint

Use a case analysis over the structure of values drawn from a `Maybe`
type.
