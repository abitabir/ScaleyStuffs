In a _binary search tree_ if *k* is the key in a node, then all keys in the left subtree must be less than *k*, and all the keys in the right subtree must be greater than *k*. Consider a database table (like smallDB) with student-id and name pair, represented as a binary search tree. 


Write a function `stdUpdate` which takes a student-id, a new name and a database organised as a binary search tree, and returns a new tree with the student's new name. However, you are expected to return an error message if a valid record with the provided student-id does not exist in the database. You will need to define an appropriate type for 'Error', as part of your solution.

Your solution should satisfy:
