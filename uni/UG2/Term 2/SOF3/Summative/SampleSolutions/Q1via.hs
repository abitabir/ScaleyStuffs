Consider the type of students record `Students`: 

-}

type Students = [(Name, Age, College)]
type Name = String 
type Age = Int 
type College = String 

{-

A bus will normally carry students between campuses and records of all the students travelling on a particular bus are maintained. If a student boards the bus, his/her record is added to the bus database and the record is removed when the student gets off the bus. Below is the current state of bus 66 in a form of a database with students records `onBus66`.

Write a function `colleges` that takes an age and returns a list of all colleges with students currently onboard bus 66 with that age. 

Your solution should satisfy:
